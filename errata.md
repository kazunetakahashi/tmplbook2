# Errata found by me

I have been reading this book (1st printing) since 2019-07-29. Before I started, I checked [the official errata page of this book](http://tmplbook.com/errata2_1.html). But I have found several mistakes which still remains in this book as follows. I'll tell them to the authors when I complete reading this book. This is a memo.

## Errata

p.38, the last paragraph, "Because it is more readable (always having the defined type name on the left side of the `=`," should have been "Because it is more readable (always having the defined type name on the left side of the `=`),".
